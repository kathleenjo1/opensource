      <description>T-Mobile runs Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform at a very large scale (â‰ˆ100K application instances!), with a wide range of applications from across the organization spanning finance, payments, retail, and customer care. Monitoring such a large-scale Cloud Foundry environment is super challenging, yet mission-critical, for running the business operations seamlessly. We need to not only monitor important platform KPIs, but also the most frequently exercised workflows involving critical platform components and services.</description>

      <description>Overview At T-Mobile, we have been making a large push toward cloud infrastructures. Through this process, we have been taking large monoliths from the past and breaking them into a series of microservices. This allows us to easily scale parts of services which are overloaded with requests and to increase the redundancy of our systems by having backups ready to go in the event one of them crashes or the hosting hardware has issues.</description>
