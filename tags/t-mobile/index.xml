      <description>Hi all, I&amp;rsquo;m Joe Searcy, Member of Technical Staff on the Platform Engineering team here at T-Mobile and I&amp;rsquo;m joined by Torin Sandall, Software Engineer at Styra and Co-founder/Core Contributor for the Open Policy Agent (OPA) project, to help tell the story behind one of T-Mobile&amp;rsquo;s latest open source projects, MagTape.
History &amp;amp; Motivation Here at T-Mobile we&amp;rsquo;re ALL-IN on containers and container platforms like Kubernetes. We, like most companies building Kubernetes environments, came to a quick realization that empowering your developers with platforms like Kubernetes can exponentially increase the volume and velocity of applications and releases.</description>

      <description>Keeping in mind the dynamic DevOps culture in our company and others, we set out to streamline our development pipelines using a modern container-based approach. Our goal was to empower developers to have the flexibility and ease of adapting the pipeline to their development methodologies while providing more time for development and testing rather than spending time on creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
Developers can easily on-board their solutions without spending too much time learning about the underlying technology that drives the pipeline.</description>

      <description>Containers, Kubernetes and Health Checks for the Win! With the massive adoption of containers, many large enterprises as well as startups embracing containers in their application architecture patterns. With this huge growth, we have new challenges to monitor 1000’s of containers running in 10’s and 100’s of Container Platforms such as Kubernetes.
There are many APM (Application Performance Management) products that provide end to end monitoring of application services. However, it can be complicated to build dashboards to get simple status of these services.</description>

      <title>Monarch: App-level Chaos Engineering</title>

      <guid>/blog/posts/monarch-app-level/</guid>
      <description>Motivation As we have talked about in an earlier post, Chaos Engineering is a method by which the stability of complicated cloud infrastructures can be assessed and validated. The current Chaos Engineering tools do not support application-specific attacks, but rather vm-specific attacks. Now, this works if each application is on its own VM, but a lot of our applications are deployed in Cloud Foundry which moves apps without the developers even needing to know what VM their container is running on.</description>

      <description>Reliable, maintainable test automation, delivered by anyone.
Continuous Delivery drives towards faster time to market which in turns demands new code to be tested and verified at high speed. For many years, QA and development teams have leveraged test automation tools to allow more tests to be run in a shorter amount of time. However, some teams may not have enough runway to build test automation &amp;ldquo;SDET&amp;rdquo; skillsets to meet demanding release timeline.</description>

      <description>Why I wrote Orchestration Desk? Hello everybody !! I will be writing my first tech blog today. The topic I will be covering is &amp;ldquo;why I wrote a open source module &amp;lsquo;Orchestration-Desk&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; (https://github.com/tmobile/orchestration-desk/wiki) along with one of my favorite topic &amp;ldquo;Feature Toggles&amp;rdquo;. Feature toggles are very popular among software industry /teams that wants continuous development and release of software products. The teams want the ability to show/hide features on demand. I believe any team can create their own little feature toggles system using some of the popular tools available to them.</description>

      <description>Purpose: To control an alarm using a Raspberry Pi and Python At T-Mobile, our development teams run pipelines to build, test, and deploy our code. Any disruption in the pipeline means new code can&amp;rsquo;t be delivered, so fixing pipeline issues when they arise becomes top priority. To emphasize the importance of having an &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; pipeline, we wanted a way to alert the teams explicitly, rather than just notifications via email/chat, when there&amp;rsquo;s a failure in the job pipeline.</description>

      <description>Following last week’s efforts highlighted in our previous ‘PR of the Week’ post, I decided to select NEXT PR #347. Pull request 347, titled ‘Inbound filters operating for AAD’, is a direct downstream step in creating the Azure and Active Directory Integration Engine.
At the end of the hackathon hosted by Microsoft at the Microsoft Reactor in Seattle, we had two different providers capable of ingesting and loading data into the Rethink DB.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had a chance to review NEXT PR #305. This was a fun one, as it came while the NEXT team was on the Microsoft Reactor campus in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood, collaborating in a code-with style hackathon, to develop some of the Azure and Active Directory Integration Engine components.
The Microsoft Reactors (there&amp;rsquo;s also one in San Francisco) definitely fit the mold of TV-style hip innovative office space.</description>

      <description>Gartner predicts that &amp;ldquo;through 2020, 95 percent of cloud security failures will be the customer&amp;rsquo;s fault.&amp;rdquo; The very nature of public cloud, the ease at which developers can create, modify and delete resources &amp;ndash;gives us the agility we love but also makes it easy to overlook security guidelines. The dynamic nature of the cloud further complicates matters, especially if you have a very large footprint.

      <description>It was one year ago today (on my birthday) that T-Mobile publicly embraced the open source community with the release of Jazz — a framework to unlock the full potential of serverless computing. It was both the start of a new journey for T-Mobile and a significant milestone along a path that we have been on for the past two and a half years: from telco to technology company.
So, I think now is a great time to reflect on the progress we made over the last year…</description>

      <title>The Start of Chaos Engineering at T-Mobile</title>

      <description>Overview At T-Mobile, we have been making a large push toward cloud infrastructures. Through this process, we have been taking large monoliths from the past and breaking them into a series of microservices. This allows us to easily scale parts of services which are overloaded with requests and to increase the redundancy of our systems by having backups ready to go in the event one of them crashes or the hosting hardware has issues.</description>

      <title>Introducing Project Casquatch</title>

      <description>Introducing Project Casquatch At T-Mobile, we have been rapidly developing new applications on top of a micro-service architecture through a combination of Java and Cassandra, including all the latest and greatest technologies. This is great except that Cassandra pushes a significant amount of the performance tuning and high availability configuration from the database layer up to the application layer. This leads to a few problems for the enterpise as all these policies are individually implemented (or not) by each service and database availability is now out of central control, leaving each developer to implement as they see fit.</description>

      <description>VMware Harbor is an open source all in one enterprise-class container registry that extends open source docker distribution and adds many functionalities that are typically required in the enterprise such as:
  container registry
  container image vulnerability scanning
  notary (Content trust and digital signing)
  We recently went through an evaluation process of VMware Harbor and had to deploy it on our Azure Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will walk through how we use geo distance search queries with Elasticsearch to provide &amp;ldquo;find a store&amp;rdquo; experience within our mobile application. Currently, the microservice that powers this experience in our mobile app is developed using Vert.x which is a Java based framework that is quite commonly used for developing microservices. We recently ported this service to a serverless application and decided to develop in golang.</description>

      <description>For over four years, T-Mobile has been on a journey to transform the wireless industry. We call this our Un-carrier revolution. For as many years, we’ve also been on a journey with the public cloud. It has been a key enabler of innovation. As we’ve gained experience, our solutions have matured, and so has our understanding of our role in T-Mobile and the greater technology community.
In those four years, we’ve had four generations of cloud architectures, and we don’t expect the pace of innovation to slow down anytime soon.</description>

      <description>With the hype surrounding blockchain rapidly approaching fever-pitch, both businesses and consumers around the world are on high alert. We don’t need to point to the next big Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to prove that point - with Bitcoin trading at over $8,000 and players like IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel investing significant resources into their blockchain positions, we can be confident that innovation is on the horizon.
As a Senior Architect in T-Mobile’s Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE), I have the unique opportunity to represent our efforts working with this exciting technology.</description>
