      <description>You’ve built a model that stakeholders love. Now, you need it to retrain every day… and that requires a whole new architecture.
In this article, Mark Eric Hanson outlines why automated ML model retraining is important, the use cases it solves for T-Mobile, and how to stitch the tech together to recreate a similar implementation of your own. Its a fascinating read, and a good behind-the-scenes look at how we approach problem-solving at T-Mobile.</description>
