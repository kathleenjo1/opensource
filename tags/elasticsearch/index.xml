      <description>T-Mobile runs Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform at a very large scale (â‰ˆ100K application instances!), with a wide range of applications from across the organization spanning finance, payments, retail, and customer care.

We recently ported this service to a serverless application and decided to develop in golang.</description>
