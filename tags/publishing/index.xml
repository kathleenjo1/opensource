      <description>Percy Percy is a configuration as code editor, it is not a configuration distribution system like Spring Cloud Configuration Server.
Percy facilitates editing configuration files in a terse (de-hydrated) format that is intended to simplify maintenance of external configuration files of an app or service across multiple deployed environments. The Percy project includes a set of validation and hydration scripts that will expand the de-hydrated ( DRY) configuration files into a set of JSON files, one for every deployment environment.</description>

Our Requirements When we first started talking with Steve and Tim about launching our opensource site to show case lot of the great work our teams are doing, both Steve and Tim wanted to make sure we leveraged opensource tools and not rely on any internal tools or processes.</description>
